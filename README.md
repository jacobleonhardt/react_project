# Vertical Explorer
(Like Untapped, but for Rock Climbers)

Users can access Vertical Explorer by visiting https://vertical-explorer.herokuapp.com/ If the user is not logged in, or does not have an account, the splash page will render, prompting them to login or create an account. If the user has an account and is logged in, the page will render the logged in user's profile.

Once logged in, users can create, update, and delete climbing routes, and climbs - which are a collection of routes. Once created, these climbs will be posted as a feed on the user's profile.

To logout, the user can simply click the Logout button, located in the dropdown menu.
